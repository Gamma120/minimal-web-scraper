Motivation
----------

This project was created because I didn't want to read the Scrapy's documentation. I found Scrapy a little bit overkill for my needs. The framework structure created by ``scrapy startproject <project_name>`` was bigger than my own project!

More serously, the main reason was that I wanted to create a Python library. This is my first one and it made me discover tools (linting, type checking...) and understand imports and installations of Python libraries.
